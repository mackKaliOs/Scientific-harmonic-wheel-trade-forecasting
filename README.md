# Scientific Harmonic Wheel — Unified Resonance Map

### Overview
This project constructs a quantitative resonance framework connecting:
- **Gann geometry** — price/time vectors and angular harmonics
- **Kozyrev temporal energy flow** — forward and reverse phase dynamics
- **Dewey cyclic taxonomy** — long-term periodicities (solar, lunar, geomagnetic, financial)

Together they form a tri-axial harmonic engine that models both
economic and astrophysical rhythms within a unified temporal geometry.

### Core Concept
**Market Field Coherence Node**  
> The intersection of all three harmonic domains — where energy, price, and time achieve phase alignment.  
This node serves as the analytical origin for real-asset studies (Gold, S&P 500, Oil, EUR/USD).

### Features
- Circular harmonic visualization (`scientific_harmonic_wheel.png`)
- Polar coordinate plotting for geometric resonance
- Modular design for adding new datasets (solar flux, Schumann resonance, CPI cycles, etc.)
- Extensible for AI-assisted forecasting and neuromorphic-time modeling

---

### Scientific Lineage
- **W.D. Gann** — Market geometry and the law of vibration  
- **N.A. Kozyrev** — Causal mechanics and asymmetrical time flow  
- **E.R. Dewey** — Foundation for empirical cycle research

### Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/scientific-harmonic-wheel.git
cd scientific-harmonic-wheel
python harmonic_wheel.py
```
